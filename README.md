# nesEmu_rust (Nes emulator written in Rust) (WIP)

This is a re-implementation of the Nes Emulator written by OneLoneCoder [(link to repo)](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES/)  
Still lots of work to do on this. Background tiles are working and drawn, sprites are not drawn, audio does not work.  
Currently only supports roms with Mapper type zero and Cartridge type 1.
